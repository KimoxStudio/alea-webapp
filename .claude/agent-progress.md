- [12:39] Build: PASSED, typecheck: PASSED, lint: PASSED
- [12:39] ✅ Complete — commit ee8553b pushed to feat/KIM-366-replace-cron-with-lazy-eval

#### [KIM-366] qa-engineer — Test availability filter
- [12:46] Started — writing lazy-expiry filter tests for tables-service
- [12:46] Test A (expired pending) — PASS: 70min old pending reservation does NOT block availability
- [12:46] Test B (active reservation) — PASS: Active reservations still block (regression check)
- [12:46] Test C (fresh pending) — PASS: 5min old pending still blocks (within grace period)
- [12:46] Test D (activated pending) — PASS: Activated pending does NOT expire

- [12:46] Test F (mixed scenario) — PASS: Expired/active/fresh mixed correctly
- [12:47] Test suite: 23/23 tables-service tests PASSED ✓
- [12:47] ✅ Complete — commit 76860ee: comprehensive lazy-expiry filter tests added

- [12:30] Started security review of commit ee8553b
- [12:31] Verified UTC time handling (getDatabaseNow, matches reservations-service)
- [12:32] Confirmed RLS enforcement (admin client safe, function is SECURITY DEFINER)
- [12:33] Boundary check: 60min, <= operator correct per KIM-366 spec
- [12:33] Secrets scan: PASS (no API keys, tokens, or credentials found)
- [12:34] Input validation: PASS (no new user-supplied input, already parameterized)
- [12:34] Low-severity note: PENDING_EXPIRY_MINUTES is duplicate of GRACE_PERIOD_MINUTES (not blocking, values in sync)
- [12:35] ✅ APPROVED — no security issues, PR ready

#### [KIM-366] GitHub comment reply
- [12:36] Responded to review blocker in English
